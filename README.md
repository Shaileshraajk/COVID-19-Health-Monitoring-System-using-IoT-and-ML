# COVID-19-Health-Monitoring-System-using-IoT-and-ML
COVID-19 Health monitoring system, which monitors for any abnormalities in the patient's sensor readings and alerts the hospital authorities to take necessary actions.

It is capable to monitoring the patient’s health and detect any abnormal activities in the patient’s body readings. This device can monitor the temperature, blood pressure, oxygen levels and heart rate of the patients in real time. If there are any abnormal change in the data then the doctor is immediately informed via an e-mail and a SMS.

This is achieved by the incorporation of Machine Learning in IoT. The most useful feature of ML for IoT is that it can detect outliers and abnormal activity and trigger the necessary red flags. As it learns more and more about a phenomenon, it becomes more accurate and efficient.

In an interconnected world, human mistakes are quickly corrected by algorithms. This helps optimize the entire process through feedback mechanisms. The predictive component of the system can identify the correct input to get the expected output.

When powered by ML, IoT can work flawlessly both at an individual level, so that you don’t mess up your morning routine, for example, and at a collective level. The latter case can be illustrated with interconnected cars that can communicate with each other and perform dynamic rerouting to avoid traffic jams.
